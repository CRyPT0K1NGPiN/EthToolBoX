# EthToolBoX
A basic Ethereum Toolbox in Java

This is one of my first projects in Java that i feel a passion for creating.  When done, it will be able to operate on the Ethereum blockchain in various capacities; buy/sell Eth and ERC-20 tokens, get/log pricing data and historical pricing data (maybe), deploy pre-coded smart contracts && interact w them. And finally a bot to automate buying and selling via the smart contracts. This project is still very very early in development as you can see, i just started today. Any suggestiong or coding help if needed would be cool. The main languages I can see the program speaking so far will be Java & Solidity. Have a nice day.
